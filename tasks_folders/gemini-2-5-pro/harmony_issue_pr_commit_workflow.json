The current implementation is not thread-safe, leading to corrupted tokenizer file downloads and unpredictable behavior under concurrent access.\\n\\n## Root Cause\\nThe root cause of this bug is the lack of a file locking mechanism to protect the tokenizer download and initialization process. When multiple threads execute this critical section at the same time, they can interfere with each other's file operations.\\n\\n## Expected Solution\\n- Implement a mutex-based file locking mechanism to ensure that only one thread can download and load a tokenizer at a time.\\n- Use a thread-safe initialization pattern to prevent redundant downloads and ensure the tokenizer is loaded only once.\\n- Provide an offline loading API to allow users to load tokenizers from a local file path, as requested in issue #1.\\n\\nThis bug is related to the feature request in #1 and the original race condition report in #6.\\nKeywords: \\\"multiple threads\\\", \\\"tokenizer file downloads\\\", \\\"mutex-based file locking\\\"\",\"owner\":\"mcpmark-eval\",\"repo\":\"harmony\",\"title\":\"Bug: race condition in HarmonyEncoding during concurrent access\"}{\"branch\":\"fix/race-condition-tokenizer-loading\",\"from_branch\":\"main\",\"owner\":\"mcpmark-eval\",\"repo\":\"harmony\"}",
