The harmony core's dependency on a specific `require` pattern for its tokenization logic means that a pure ESM environment is **breaking compatibility**. Our analysis shows that the **core tokenization** process is tightly coupled with a dynamic `require` that cannot be replicated with static ESM imports.\\n\\nFurthermore, we've encountered significant **build system constraints**. The webpack configuration required for ESM bundling conflicts with the assumptions made by the harmony core's build process. The core library is fundamentally **CommonJS required**, and any attempt to shim or polyfill this behavior introduces unacceptable complexity and performance overhead.\\n\\nGiven these findings, this **approach is not viable** without a major refactoring of the harmony core itself. The existing CommonJS dependencies are too deeply integrated to be easily replaced. We recommend pausing this effort until the core library is updated to support modern module systems.\",\"issue_number\":28,\"owner\":\"mcpmark-eval\",\"repo\":\"harmony\"}{\"body\":\"The attempt to migrate the JavaScript demo to ESM has been blocked by significant **technical constraints**. Our investigation, detailed in PR #28, revealed that the harmony core has a hard **CommonJS dependency** that is incompatible with an ESM-only environment.\\n\\nThe primary issue stems from **harmony core limitations**, where the tokenization logic relies on a dynamic `require` pattern that cannot be replicated with static ESM imports. This creates a fundamental conflict in **build system compatibility** between the modern ESM approach and the legacy CommonJS requirements of the core library.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this means the proposed ESM migration is **not viable at this time**.
